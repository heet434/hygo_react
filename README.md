# HyGo: Hygiene on the Go

HyGo was the startup founded by Kameng hostel in Kriti'24, the annual inter Hostel technical competition of [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), in which we secured first place. The social startup focuses on environment friendly products like the Water Hyacinth and Cotton waste paper based toilet sheets. You can refer to the website [HyGo](https://heet434.github.io/hygo_react/) for further information on the startup and the product.

## The Website

Initially as a learning attempt, as this website was just a landing page, I created [this website](https://heet434.github.io/hygo/) in Vanilla JS. ([link to the repo](https://github.com/heet434/hygo)) Then as I started learning ReactJS, I thought why not practice on the same website and create one for my startup, so I created the same in React, and the results are in this repo. [hygo_react](https://heet434.github.io/hygo_react/)</br>
I use <ins>react-scroll</ins>, <ins>react-scroll-motion</ins> and <ins>react-intersection-observer</ins> for some of the animations I've used. </br>
<ins>React Modal</ins> is helpful for creating a simple payment option through UPI QR code. For emails after payment conveying customer information from the form, as there is no backend, I use <ins>emailJS</ins> to send the information from the form through email.
